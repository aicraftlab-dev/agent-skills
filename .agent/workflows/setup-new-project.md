description: How to setup the product-to-market skills in a new project.
---

To equip your new project with the specialized product, design, and development skills, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to your new project directory.**
2. **Run the installation script from this repository:**
// turbo
```bash
/Users/alan.reynoso/Projects/skills/bin/ag-skills.sh local
```

3. **Verify the installation:**
Ask Antigravity: "What skills are available in this workspace?"

Note: To install these skills **globally** (so they are available in every folder automatically), run:
```bash
/Users/alan.reynoso/Projects/skills/bin/ag-skills.sh global
```
