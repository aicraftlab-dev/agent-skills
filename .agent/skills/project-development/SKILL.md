# Project Development

This skill focuses on the organizational and management side of building products, ensuring that the team (or agent) stays on track and follows a structured timeline.

## When to use this skill
- When breaking down a large feature into smaller, manageable tasks.
- When creating a project timeline or Gantt chart (ASCII).
- When prioritizing a backlog of features.
- When setting up project management tools (GitHub Issues, Trello, etc.).

## How to use it
1. **Task Decomposition**: Break the high-level goal into granular sub-tasks.
2. **Prioritization**: Use frameworks like MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have) to prioritize tasks.
3. **Timeline Planning**: Create a rough estimate of how long each phase will take.
4. **Project Documentation**: Maintain a `PROJECT_LOG.md` or `TASKS.md` to track progress and blockers.
5. **Stakeholder Updates**: Provide clear summaries of what has been completed and what is next.

## Constraints
- Focus on organization and "The How" of delivery.
- Avoid getting bogged down in implementation code; keep it high-level.
- Flag risks or blockers early.
