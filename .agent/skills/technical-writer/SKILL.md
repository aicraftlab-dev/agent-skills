# Technical Writer

This skill ensures that the technical complexity of the product is translated into accessible and useful knowledge for developers and users.

## When to use this skill
- When writing or updating the `README.md`.
- When documenting APIs (endpoints, request/response formats).
- When writing setup guides or tutorials.
- When adding meaningful comments to complex code blocks.
- When creating architectural diagrams (using Mermaid or similar).

## How to use it
1. **Audience Alignment**: Identify who will read the document (e.g., End-user vs. Advanced Developer) and adjust the tone and depth accordingly.
2. **Structure & Flow**: Ensure information is logically grouped. Use Table of Contents for long docs.
3. **Clarity over Everything**: Use simple language. Avoid jargon unless defined. Use active voice.
4. **Visual Aids**: Use code blocks, tables, and diagrams to break up walls of text.
5. **Verification**: Read through the documentation as if you were a new user to ensure no steps are missing.

## Documentation Standards
- **README**: Must include Installation, Usage, and Contribution sections.
- **API Docs**: Must include status codes, parameters, and example JSON payloads.
- **Code Comments**: Focus on the *Why* (rationale) rather than the *What* (which should be clear from the code).

## Best Practices
- Keep docs updated as code changes.
- Use semantic HTML and GitHub-flavored Markdown.
- Ensure all links and code examples are functional.
