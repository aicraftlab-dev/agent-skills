# Product Design & UX

This skill ensures that products are not only functional but visually stunning and intuitive.

## When to use this skill
- When creating UI mockups for a new application.
- When defining a color palette or typography.
- When planning the user journey and interaction flow.
- When the user asks to "make it look premium".

## How to use it
1. **User Flow**: Map out the screens and interactions required for the task.
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Define key elements, layout structure, and focal points.
3. **Mockup Generation**: Use `generate_image` to create high-fidelity UI mockups. Always provide a detailed prompt for "premium, modern aesthetics".
4. **Design System**: Establish CSS variables for colors, spacing, and typography in `index.css`.
5. **Interactive Feedback**: Plan hover states, transitions, and micro-animations.

## Design Principles
- **Modern & Premium**: Use glassmorphism, subtle gradients, and high-quality typography.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure high contrast and legible font sizes.
- **Consistency**: All components must share the same design language.
