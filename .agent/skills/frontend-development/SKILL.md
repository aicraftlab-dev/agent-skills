# Frontend Development

This skill focuses on delivering an exceptional user experience through code.

## When to use this skill
- When building React/Next.js/Vite components.
- When styling pages with CSS or Tailwind.
- When managing global state (Redux, Zustand, Context).
- When implementing complex animations or transitions.

## How to use it
1. **Core Setup**: Initialize the project with modern tools (e.g., `npx create-next-app`).
2. **Design Implementation**: Follow the specs in `product-design-ux`. Use CSS variables for a theme-able system.
3. **Component Building**: Create modular, reusable components. Prioritize visual excellence.
4. **State & Logic**: Implement efficient state management and data fetching.
5. **Polishing**: Add hover effects, loading skeletons, and smooth entry animations.

## Aesthetic Requirements
- **No Placeholders**: Use `generate_image` for realistic assets.
- **Glassmorphism**: Use `backdrop-filter: blur()` for modern overlays.
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design is a must.
