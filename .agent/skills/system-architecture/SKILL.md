# System Architecture

This skill focuses on building scalable, maintainable, and robust technical foundations.

## When to use this skill
- When selecting technologies (Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- When designing the database schema.
- When defining the API contract (REST, GraphQL).
- When planning for scalability and high availability.

## How to use it
1. **Tech Stack Selection**: Justify choices based on project requirements (e.g., performance vs. development speed).
2. **Data Modeling**: Define entities, relationships, and indexing strategies.
3. **Component Layout**: Decide between Monolithic, Microservices, or Serverless based on complexity.
4. **Security Architecture**: Plan for authentication (JWT/OAuth), authorization, and data encryption.
5. **Documentation**: Create an `ARCHITECTURE.md` to document decisions.

## Best Practices
- **Dry/Solid**: Adhere to clean code principles from the start.
- **Fail-Safe**: Design with error handling and circuit breakers in mind.
- **Observability**: Plan for logging and monitoring.
